           <p>She gets people to confess their crimes for a living.<br>
            He knows she's hiding a terrible secret.<br>
            It's time for the truth to come out…</p>

            <p>Poe Webb, host of a popular true crime podcast, invites people to anonymously confess crimes they've committed to her audience. She can't guarantee the police won't come after her "guests," but her show grants simultaneous anonymity and instant fame—a potent combination that's proven difficult to resist. After an episode recording, Poe usually erases both criminal and crime from her mind.</p>

            <p>But when a strange and oddly familiar man appears on her show, Poe is forced to take a second look. Not only because he claims to be her mother's murderer from years ago, but because Poe knows something no one else does. Her mother's murderer is dead.</p>

            <p>Poe killed him.</p>

            <p>From the USA Today bestselling author of <em>The Dead Girl in 2A</em> and <em>The New Neighbor</em> comes a chilling new thriller that forces the question: are murderers always the bad guys?</p>
